Game by Sergio Such @ 1DAM 2022

This game has auto-generated words to guess while playing.

You can create your own words to play by simply editing the "words.js" file.
words1 = level 1 (easy)
words2 = level 2 (medium)
words3 = level 3 (hard)




*******ONLY FOR TESTING PURPOSES*******

If you want to skip any lvl, you just need to replace the variable "cont" in the
main.js, at line 24.

VALUES:
cont = 1 --> easy / level 1
cont = 2 --> medium / level 2
cont = 3 --> hard / level 3
